  blurb: "Product planning and design of chatbot assistant to transition common phone-based customer support inquiries to web-based chat and SMS",
  description: "Client had a chatbot assistant to help customers with basic customer service needs. For their next major iteration, the goal was to enhance the assistant with the ability to handle more complex inquiries and directly interface with internal systems.

  We identified the customer support categories that normally require the most agent involvement, as these represent the highest cost from a care channel standpoint. We designed conversation flows for this initial set of support categories and drafted technical requirements to support the full journey from the backend.",

  description: "Client was developing a new video streaming service for an initial launch in the US market. In addition to broader program management and data delivery management responsibilities, we led individual workstreams and their deliverables.

  As lead of the reporting workstream, we defined the process by which internal data sources were used to calculate revenue share, as negotiated with vendors and partners. Given that revenue share amounts were derived from performance metrics involving complex conditional logic, we designed visualizations of the end-to-end data flow process along with the calculation methodology.",

  blurb: "Product strategy support and executive presentation design for media streaming app platform",
  description: "Client operated in multiple markets around the world, offering a diverse lineup of media streaming devices and TV set-top boxes. These devices ran on fragmented operating systems with different consumer app stores. This meant that an engineer developing a streaming app for client\'s ecosystem (e.g., a Netflix app) needed to write the same app multiple times for each app store.

  In an effort to streamline the process for app developers and their own internal operations, client sought to form a strategy to unify their technology stack and build a single organization-wide app platform that could run on all of their hardware across all markets.",

We helped client assess their entire end-to-end customer lifecycle strategy and took an in-depth look at the product itself. We analyzed the functionality of the product in the context of their main competitors, and made recommendations to improve the product as well as their overall sales strategy.",

For the development of their new ad campaign planning tool, we defined the product requirements and use cases, along with initial wireframes and mockups.

  In addition, we assessed the organization\'s existing portfolio of ad tech products as a whole, including those of recent acquisitions. We made recommendations on portfolio optimization through an analysis of each advertising product in the context of the overall advertising value chain and market landscape.",

The goal was to be able to accurately predict demand for products at each of their retail locations using a combination of unstructured and structured data sources such as social media feeds, weather forecasts, market disruptions, and historical trends.
