If I’m on vacation and I want to splurge with points, I know to look for a St. Regis or a Luxury Collection property. If I’m traveling for business, I know that most larger cities will have a Marriott or Sheraton property that are reasonably priced for a few nights’ stay.

Content.create(
  text_content: "The above is a Sheraton property in Thailand, which is comprised entirely of villas. Based on the pictures, it looks like every room features some sort of outdoor space and pool, clearly a far cry from the average Sheraton. Yet somehow, this luxurious property shares a name with the two other Sheraton properties mentioned above, and countless others like them.

  It’s a common practice for hotels to be owned by franchisees and management companies that pay to license a chain’s branding and assets, so it is not necessarily the Marriott company that gives the direction to open these vastly different Sheraton properties. But in allowing so much variation across properties that use the same brand, it dilutes the brand identity to the point where the brand communicates very little to the consumer.
  
  The problem has to do with some of the primary factors that go into a person’s decision making process when choosing a hotel — perceived quality and value. To me, this is where most hotel brands fall short. The quality and value of a hotel brand can vary so much from property to property that the brand is no longer an effective barometer for my decision making. It seems like hotel brands have a checklist of features that qualify it to be part of a that brand (e.g., all Sheraton properties must have a lounge, all W Hotel properties must use Momo brand bath products). But as a hotel guest, I don’t measure my experience based solely on a binary checklist — if a hotel claims to have a gym but only has 3 cardio machines in a small space (a real experience I’ve had in multiple hotel “gyms”), it doesn’t fulfill my needs as a gym. In this situation, the amenity may as well not exist for me.
  
  When I travel to a new city now, I look at photos and reviews of each property before selecting one because I don’t know what I would be getting based on the brand alone. Without doing this research, I have no idea if a Sheraton property has rooms that have been renovated or if they have dated interiors from decades ago. As a consumer, this extra effort largely defeats the purpose of maintaining an international hotel brand in the first place.
  
  What’s particularly baffling is that as of this writing, there are over 30 brands under the Marriott umbrella. You would think that with so many brands, each one would attempt to carve out a specific niche that is unique to that brand. But in my experience, there is so much overlap between these brands that it begs to question what purpose some of them serve.",

  text_content: "This may be subjective, but the Westin does not appear more premium to me at all. If anything, I would even give a slight edge to the Courtyard, particularly the bathroom. Perhaps the Westin has certain items in its checklist that allow it to technically claim they have more amenities (e.g., a full service restaurant, a swimming pool), but does the presence of an amenity automatically qualify a property to be more premium? I would say no, especially if that property is clearly more dated in other, more important areas, such as the actual guest room and bathroom. If you were to show someone these two properties side by side and ask them which is the “Premium” one, my guess is that most people would choose the Courtyard over the Westin.

  What’s the point in categorizing the Westin brand as a “Premium” category hotel, when they can be outclassed by certain properties in the “Select” category? There’s little value in a premium brand that offers a truly premium experience in some properties and subpar one in others, both to the hotel and the prospective guest.
  
  To be clear, I’ve encountered these problems of brand inconsistency from all of the major hotel chains, not just Marriott. There is obviously no quick and simple solution for hotel chains to address the aforementioned branding inconsistencies, given that there are thousands of properties around the world that are run by external management companies. To start, perhaps it is time for Marriott and others to apply a stricter set of guidelines around each of its brands for new properties. As for existing properties, it wouldn’t be financially feasible for all of them to undergo expensive renovations to align with new brand principles. A cheaper stopgap solution may be to rebrand existing properties based on how they align with stricter brand guidelines. Here’s my take on the Marriott properties mentioned in this post (judging them as they currently are), grouping them into the broader classes rather than specific brands:",

I believe all hotel chains should put a much greater focus on defining each of their brands with perceivable characteristics that are consistent across all of a brand’s properties. If there is ever a day where I am able to travel to a new city, book a stay at a Westin sight unseen, and be completely certain that I am having a more “premium” experience there than if I were to have stayed at the Courtyard a few blocks over, I will know they have succeeded.",

  This is not a problem specific to Netflix. I found examples on other apps as well, where an app looks identical on two different platforms but contains confusing inconsistencies.

But good design should aim to create a simple experience for everyone, not just power users. The problem in the above examples is not that the apps don’t function exactly the same way — user experiences can and often should be adapted to optimize against the size of the display and the input method. The problem is that these apps built for different platforms look nearly the same but function slightly differently, resulting in a suboptimal user experience. If the UIs for these apps need to be adapted to different platforms, these variations should always be crafted meaningfully with specific purpose, with no element placed by chance.",

  text_content: "As a New Yorker, going grocery shopping usually means walking around the store with a basket that gets stacked or taken away at the cash register at the end of my trip. With real estate so limited, it’s rare to see a stray basket lying around taking up precious space. Whenever I go out into the suburbs, the customer journey is perceivably different; large shopping carts are the norm, and they unfortunately get left behind all over the parking lot by shoppers who fail to bring them back to the cart return stations.

It’s common for larger retailers to employ staff dedicated to attending carts, but their jobs are certainly made harder for each cart that fails to be returned by customers properly. If we approach this as a design problem, we can start with the carts and return stations themselves. First, are the stations spread too far apart?",

  text_content: "The above image is a satellite view of a Costco in Brooklyn that I’ve been to many times. From what I can see, this section of the parking lot facing the entrance of the store only has two return stations (highlighted in yellow). I’ve indicated where I can see stray carts left behind unreturned (circled in red), while giving the benefit of the doubt to a few other carts I can see next to car trunks that may be there temporarily while the customer unloads.

  In this very unscientific exercise, it appears that carts are left behind in sections of the parking lot where there is no ease of access to return the cart to a station. In each of the examples circled in red, the customer would have to go around an entire row of parked cars to reach one. It seems like a simple remedy would be to convert a few parking spaces in the bottom-most row into return stations.
  
  While creating even more return stations throughout the lot would likely improve cart return rates further, there’s clearly a tradeoff — the more return stations there are, the fewer spaces remain for parking spots, which can be costly in a place like New York where space is so limited to begin with. The other option is to design a solution that tackles user behavior. In the current state, a customer has no incentive to return a cart to a station. There is neither a reward nor a punishment for failing to do so, aside from perhaps the judgment and dirty look from a nearby observer (which, in certain collectivist societies such as Korea, may be a strong enough incentive!).
  
  Luckily, a solution to influence user behavior has already been designed and is in use in many other countries throughout the world. For example, it’s common to find shopping carts that look like this in Korea:",

  text_content: "Carts are chained together, and in order to unlock one, you must put insert a 100 Korean won coin as shown (more or less the value of a US dime). When you return your cart, you get your coin back. It’s a simple but effective solution to embed the return of a cart into the user journey. It’s not even that the 100 won cost carries a big financial weight, but it’s the act of giving something up and receiving it back that habituates and reinforces the behavior of returning the cart at the end of one’s shopping journey.

  As mentioned, this shopping cart design is used in many countries around the world, and I think it’s about time it makes its way over to the United States. It’s important to note that the lock mechanism is only one piece of the design here; in order to create a good customer experience, the other piece must also be present, which is to ensure that there is a sufficient number of return stations spread out across the parking lot to minimize the inconvenience to the customer.
  
  The reason why I dedicated an entire post to shopping carts is to show that good design extends down to the details of a product or experience. The locks are small pieces of hardware that can be retrofitted on existing shopping carts and return stations, and this little design element is a powerful tool to enforce a certain action within a user journey. Making parking lots less cluttered with carts in turn enhances the customer experience for everyone, and it doesn’t even require a new innovation to achieve.",
