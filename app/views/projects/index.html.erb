  <h2>Hi! I'm Kevin.</h2>

  <p id="intro-paragraph">I spent the first chapter of my career as a management consultant working with clients in media, tech, and cable. My earlier work was mostly centered around business strategy, but I’ve expanded my focus in recent years towards product strategy and design. 

There was a moment not too long ago in which I was updating my resume for the first time in years, and it dawned on me how archaic of a format the classic one-pager has become. It was boring for me to try to describe my work history in bullet points, and I could only imagine it would be just as unengaging for those who had to read it. I knew that visual career portfolios were commonplace in the more creative fields, but bullet points on a page were still the norm among most of my consultant peers.

I’ve spent lots of time over the years building presentations for clients, transforming complex information into visually engaging materials to facilitate the exchange of ideas. I’m a firm believer in the fact that good thinking must be accompanied by good communicating for it to be impactful. With that in mind, I built this career portfolio from the ground up with the goal of telling the story of my career on a less restrictive canvas.

Out of respect for standard consulting convention, client names and deliverable samples from my work as a management consultant have been obfuscated to maintain confidentiality of sensitive information. I created the graphics used in this portfolio as illustrative snapshots of the deliverables I produced for my clients. If you’d like to see a more typical one-page resume, you can find that under the About section.

I’ve also devoted a section of my portfolio to my Musings — a collection of thoughts and observations on products, experiences, and designs I come across in my everyday.

I hope this portfolio gives you a brief but insightful look into my career so far. If there’s something you’d like to know more about or if you’d just like to chat, please feel free to drop me a line!
